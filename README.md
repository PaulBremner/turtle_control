# turtle_control
FARSCOPE workshop exercise code

Use the template to build your code from. 

The turtle_control_node and playback scripts are my solution to all the exercises, use them for reference if that is useful but you will get the most out of the workshop if you write your own.

To run things either:
roslaunch turtle_control turtle_control.launch
or
in 3 terminals
roscore
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
rosrun turtle_control turtle_control_node
